# 🌑 Psychological Horror Experience for Minecraft  
*A lightweight, atmospheric haunting system that targets players individually.*

---

## 👁 Overview  
This plugin introduces a dark, intelligent haunting system that activates when players are alone, vulnerable, or exploring the world at night.  
It creates a terrifying ambience through **client-side illusions**, **whispers**, **shadow entities**, and **fake system messages**, all of which only the targeted player can feel and see.

Nothing affects survival balance — it only enhances fear, tension, and atmosphere.

# 🌑 Features

## 👤 Shadow Entity Apparitions
A pure-black, faceless humanoid figure:
- Appears 20–30 blocks away  
- Only visible to the targeted player  
- No hitbox, no nametag  
- Vanishes instantly when approached  
- Uses packet-based rendering → **no server lag**

Rare double-entity spawns create intense moments.

---

## 🌫 Reactive Whispers
Whispers adapt to the player’s situation:
- Looking at the entity  
- Looking away  
- Being watched from a distance  
- Being in caves or forests  
- Nighttime solitude  
- Low HP or dangerous situations  

Intensity scales with proximity.

---

## 🔊 Psychological Sound Effects
Soft, subtle, positional audio:
- Footsteps  
- Breathing  
- Hum or echo  
- Door creaks  
- Block interaction sounds  
- Enderman-like static on entity vanish  

Never loud or jumpscare-like — just immersive.

## 🌘 Distance-Based Fear Scaling

| Distance       | Player Experience            |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| 25–30 blocks   | Subtle warnings               |
| 15–20 blocks   | Increased awareness           |
| 10–15 blocks   | Strong tension                |
| 5–10 blocks    | Maximum fear / urgency        |

The entity becomes more aggressive the closer it is.

## 🧠 Adaptive Horror System
To make it feel intelligent:
- Avoids repeating identical scares  
- Tracks scare cooldowns per player  
- Increases intensity if the player acts fearless  
- Sends a login message if player logs out mid-haunting  
- Rare “high-activity nights”  
- Natural silent periods for realism
